- add interaction: crud to log custom time trackings
	- remove a lot of the input fields? especially the optional ones...

- finishing touches:
	- mobile friendly
	- translations


- add API so other systems can extract and log data (expose the CRUD?)

- build a swagger client that consumes the API and uses it to remotely add data
