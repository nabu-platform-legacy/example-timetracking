- add API so other systems can extract and log data (expose the CRUD?)


- add an API application
-> add the CRUD to it
-> add the insights to it

-> dragging & dropping onto the swaggerui should work
	-> can reload the swagger ui automatically?

-> actually run them via swaggerui


use postman to call a service
-> add an accept for text/csv! (only for CRUD, the insights don't work (yet))


tiny sidestep => exposing as WSDL?
	-> the scope private is not respected!



- finishing touches:
	- mobile friendly
	- translations



- build a swagger client that consumes the API and uses it to remotely add data
